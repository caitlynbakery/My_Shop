You want to store things so that it is saved when you refresh or restart your application. The two options for storing are
on-device storage and web storage. 

On-device storage is useful for offline applications and storing data on a single device. The data persists across
app restarts, but it is ONLY available to one user. 

Web storage stores data across different devices, so that many users can access your application. Web storage requries internet
connection and data persists across app restarts.
